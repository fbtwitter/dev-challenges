## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind-css

### What I learned

Implementing a 1:1 pixel-perfect component isnâ€™t as difficult as it seems, but staying consistent with the details is crucial. Starting with small components makes it easier to adjust and find the best fit.

### Continued development

I'll focus on improving accessibility and refining the element structure as I gain more mastery.
